# How to use this

## First steps

1. Join https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamDB (needed to represent captures)
2. Open https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken and save it as `token.txt` in same folder as `cheat.php`
3. Select PHP or Python version of the script, you don't need both

## PHP

ðŸ“£ [Check this reddit thread for a complete guide and troubleshooting](https://redd.it/8t5w8v)

1. Install PHP (yes, really)
   1. Download https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.2.7-nts-Win32-VC15-x64.zip
   2. Extract zip to `C:\php`
   3. Open `php.ini-production` in a text editor
   4. Find `;extension=curl` and remove the semicolon
   5. Save as `php.ini`
2. Extract the contents of this script to the same folder
3. Run `cheat.bat`

You can also provide token directly in CLI, to ease running multiple accounts:
```
php cheat.php token1
php cheat.php token2
```
